## What it is

A **rootless-computing** peer-to-peer browser app. No backend of its own beyond the self-hosted WebRTC stack listed below. State lives in a Yjs mesh shared by everyone in the same room.

Read the principles → **https://baditaflorin.github.io/rootless-computing/principles.html**

## Quickstart

Open the live URL on two devices in the same room (set in ⚙ settings, or scan the room QR). Everything else is in-app.

For local hacking:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baditaflorin/mesh-common
git clone https://github.com/baditaflorin/mesh-word-relay
cd mesh-word-relay
npm install
npm run dev
```

`mesh-common` must sit as a **sibling** directory because `package.json` references it via `file:../mesh-common`.

## Self-hosted infrastructure

| Repo                                              | Endpoint                               | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| https://github.com/baditaflorin/signaling-server  | `wss://turn.0docker.com/ws`            | y-webrtc signaling fan-out  |
| https://github.com/baditaflorin/turn-token-server | `https://turn.0docker.com/credentials` | HMAC TURN creds, 1-hour TTL |
| https://github.com/baditaflorin/coturn-hetzner    | `turn:turn.0docker.com:3479`           | TURN relay                  |

## Settings overrides

The settings drawer lets the user override signaling and TURN endpoints. localStorage keys:

- `mesh-word-relay:signalingUrl`
- `mesh-word-relay:turnTokenUrl`
- `mesh-word-relay:iceServers`
- `mesh-word-relay:room`

If endpoints are blank or unreachable, the app falls back to STUN-only.

## Version + commit on every screen

The bottom-right footer on every screen of the live app shows:

- `source` → this repo
- `tip ♥` → PayPal
- `vX.Y.Z · <short-sha>` — version from `package.json` plus the build-time git commit

## Build & deploy

GitHub Pages serves the committed `docs/` directory on the `main` branch. There is no GitHub Actions build workflow; local Husky-style hooks gate formatting / typecheck / smoke build before each push.

```bash
npm run smoke                                    # build + sanity-check docs/
bash ../mesh-common/scripts/screenshot-app.sh    # regenerate docs/screenshot.png
```

## Privacy

<!-- mesh:privacy-section:start -->

Everything you publish to a room is visible to every peer in that room. Your local device's name, key, and choices stay local. Cryptographic signatures prove **who** wrote each entry; they do **not** prevent peers from reading or copying entries. The room URL is the access control — share it deliberately.

See `docs/privacy.md` for the full threat model — capabilities used, what other peers in the mesh see, what the self-hosted infra sees, what stays local.
